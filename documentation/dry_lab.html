Dry Lab, can you guys tell me what exactly you will be modelling as we go forward? ELI5 please</p>
<p>[5/5, 10:26 AM] Mrigank Pawagi:
    I am working on a detailed list of things we could do. For now, we will be working on molecular docking to show the binding of IL8 with our antibody. </p>
<p>[5/6, 12:35 PM] Mrigank Pawagi
Dry Lab Check out this repository about scFv Structure Modelling. In particular, read the README file.
<a class="magiclink magiclink-github magiclink-repository" href="https://github.com/iGEMIISc/scFv-Modelling" title="GitHub Repository: iGEMIISc/scFv-Modelling">iGEMIISc/scFv-Modelling</a></p>
<p>Today, we will be focusing on manual homology modelling using Modeller. After a short discussion on how to get started, we will try to directly get to modelling using the templates I have outlined in the README. </p>
<p>The purpose for generating models through different methodologies is preventing gross errors. Moreover, I came across a technique for combining multiple models by taking out the best parts from each of them. We can use this to refine our model. I will talk about this too in today&rsquo;s session. </p>
<p>I was able to use modeller on our templates. It turned out that chain C of 6Y6C is the best fit. You can find all relevant code and other files in the /modeller folder.
Feel free to post any questions on this channel. </p>

Basic Homology and Docking Tutorials
    (Dry Lab) For those of you who are interested in learning about homology and docking, I am planning to keep a discussion session over the weekend. Does Saturday afternoon (roughly 2-4:30 PM) work? We can keep another session later if we aren&rsquo;t able to cover everything planned. We will meet in the math department. Please react to this message if you plan to come. Bring your laptops along. 
    [5/4, 10:19 AM] Yukta Subramanian
        Do you plan to keep it in hybrid mode?
    [5/4, 10:22 AM] Mrigank Pawagi
        We can try. I was thinking that Varivashya and I could document the session(s) to create guides which we can later put on our wiki (does this make sense, Sheersh?). Nevertheless, one of us will make notes which you can refer to later. 
    [5/4, 10:39 AM] Sheersh Sen

        Hi, if you guys want a docking tutorial do let me know. I worked a lot with Autodock Vina and can guide you on the same. While at first the tutorials etc may appear easy to approach, they can have many nuances. 
    [5/9, 7:09 PM] Aryaman Bhutani
        Also you can approach me for BioPhysics related aspects of modelling. I also worked a bit on Molecular Dynamics simulations, and while I am not an expert at them (Megha probably has worked with them more), I can point you to resources that you will find easy to follow and absorb.</p>

<p>I have added updated models from AlphaFold and SWISS-MODEL to the repository. Would somebody like to document them in the README file? Just include rank-1 models from AlphaFold (both with and without templates). Also, include relevant data about quality of each model. Images of the models would also look good. Note that the rank-1 AlphaFold models were relaxed by AMBER; this should also be mentioned. </p>
<p>Additionally, if you are interested, you can look at the modeller directory in the &ldquo;without histag&rdquo; directory and rerun the scripts for the complete sequence. Our top template, 6y6c is the best template for the complete sequence too. </p>
<p>Let me know if you need any help.</p>
<p>[5/25, 1:27 PM] Aditya Kamath Ammembal
    Dry Lab I ran another run of the Signal peptide with the antibody sequence through SignalP6.0 instead of SignalP 5.0, which I had previously used. The results are still excellent and indicative of our using the CD33 peptide. The zip file of all data is uploaded under files.

    Raloxifene-HCl is a non-steroidal drug having antiestrogenic effects on the endometrium. This paper talks about how SLNs have been used to transport the drug. Since the LNP being used in our project will also work in a similar environment, i.e. the endometrium, pharmacokinetic data for SLNs used in this might be useful for us.

    Also, this is a good time for interested peeps to start going through SimBiology Documentation (SimBiology is just a bunch of apps for modelling, computation, simulation etc. that is relevant for us). There are tons of video tutorials on using the thing for iGEM, and you can just google them. I&rsquo;ll add a link to documentation for us to get started.

Please check the repository (<a class="magiclink magiclink-github magiclink-repository" href="https://github.com/iGEMIISc/scFv-Modelling" title="GitHub Repository: iGEMIISc/scFv-Modelling">iGEMIISc/scFv-Modelling</a>), particularly the README. I have (tentatively) completed the documentation for our modelling, and was also able to run some simple comparative analysis as previously planned. I have decided to not go with Nisha&rsquo;s advice of picking a model based on its docking efficiency because that will be logically circular, and will bias our docking results. I request the following from all of you.</p>
<p>Please read the documentation and let me know if anything needs to be clarified.</p>
<p>Check for any errors/ambiguities in the documentation and make modifications or additions (by making a &ldquo;pull request&rdquo; on GitHub; I will help you with this if you are new to git)</p>
<p>Create slides from the README! Sheersh previously suggested that we should be making everything we do presentable and now that we have some content to show, we can start doing this. If you are interested in helping out here, please contact Sheersh and work with him. As always, feel free to ask me personally or ask here on the group for any clarifications.</p>

    Dry Lab So I spent some time going through the mRNA-LNP Delivery System paper uploaded. I&rsquo;m around 10 pages into the paper (out of 23) but so far it has been a very useful resources. I have uploaded a file named &lsquo;Homework&rsquo; in the mRNA-LNP folder with relevant points I&rsquo;ve found so far. A summary follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>So the LNP enters the cytosol through cell membrane by endocytosis. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve uploaded a paper on the stability of mRNA loaded LNPs. They&rsquo;re pretty stable, so allow delivery into cells.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Release of mRNA into cytosol is by breaking down of endosome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There&rsquo;s very low release of mRNA from LNP into cytosol (only 2-3%). The entire process has been visualized in vivo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Different helper lipids give different endosomal release rates (DOPE is good, which DSPC inhibits endosomal release of mRNA)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The paper also deals with immunogenicity. The lipids do cause an increase in anti-PEG antibodies. The actual mRNA structure doesn&rsquo;t matter for the LNP immunogenicity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another paper deals with a comparative study of various mRNA delivery methods and shows why LNP methods are more efficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep updating the docx file and add more relevant papers over time.

<p>Dry Lab I have uploaded a few papers to the folder titled &ldquo;Pharmacokinetics of lnps data presentation&rdquo;. We can refer to those papers to understand what relevant questions we can answer, for example, the efficiency of drug delivery in the presence of lnps. It would also be great if we can come up with a way for pharmacokinetic analysis and biodistribution as done in the paper on docetaxel.
[6/25, 12:27 AM] Anwesha Malla
    Dry Lab I have uploaded a paper to the folder titled &ldquo;Immunogenicity and other properties of lnps&rdquo; that deals mainly with the immunogenicity of lnps . It also has many references which might be useful for studying about the pharmacokinetics of lnps. </p>

<h3 id="on-molecular-docking">On Molecular Docking<a class="headerlink" href="#on-molecular-docking" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>I figured out that our antibody-antigen was computationally too demanding for Autodock, which is generally used with small ligands. Our &ldquo;ligand&rdquo; (IL8) has somewhere around 2000 atoms! I turned to several web servers, including Patchdock (+Firedock), DockRMSD, ClusPro, ZDOCK and <strong>GRAMM</strong>. Out of these, GRAMM worked for us and provided seemingly good results (check README of <a href="https://github.com/iGEMIISc/Docking-scFv-IL8" title="https://github.com/igemiisc/docking-scfv-il8">repository</a> for GIFs). GRAMM is developed by University of Kansas. It does not give &ldquo;real&rdquo; units of energy but rather something called a shape-complementarity score. I am in touch with a PhD student from the research group maintaining GRAMM and I have requested him to share some data for us to train a regression model for determining interaction energy from GRAMM&rsquo;s score. This data <em>might</em> be useful for determining the binding efficiency of our scFv with IL8.</p>
<p><strong>To do:</strong> Figure out which of the two dockings is more effective by working out the real energies for both the methods (Free and Template-based).</p>
<h3 id="on-biomarkers">On Biomarkers<a class="headerlink" href="#on-biomarkers" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Anwesha has done a good job at collecting literature on biomarkers. It seems that besides IL8, there do exist several other chemical biomarkers, but significance of these is not very well established. </p>
<ul>
<li>(Side-exploration) What is the method for determining some of the most important of these biomarkers? Blood test?</li>
<li>One paper that takes this theoretical approach to something more concrete is <a href="https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cts.13040" title="https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cts.13040">this</a>. They relate bone mineral density with endometriosis through a long chain of relations (calcium homeostasis, elgolix, estradiol). You can also check <a href="https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1038/psp.2012.15" title="https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1038/psp.2012.15">this paper</a>, although this has much more less-relevant information.</li>
<li><a href="https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1038/psp.2012.10" title="https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1038/psp.2012.10">This paper</a> extends the above model to relate estrogen levels with endometriotic-pain (for regulating drug dosage [it seems excess estrogen causes bone mineral density loss]). </li>
<li><strong>Our goal</strong>: We want to describe, as part of our model, a way to regulate our drug dosage (and observe its action). <ul>
<li>The above papers may not directly be very useful, since they are relating a physiological phenomenon (BMD change or pain) with factors resulting from hormonal-drug usage, which we are not doing.  </li>
<li>Since our drug finally targets IL8, we need to be able to determine IL8 concentration.</li>
<li>One idea that might work is that we can take the IL8 concentration vs active lesion score data from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7573391/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc7573391/">this paper</a> and relate it with the lesion score vs endometriotic stage data from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6257623/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc6257623/">this paper</a> and the endometriotic stage (and other factors) vs pain data from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1074380499800061" title="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/s1074380499800061">this paper</a>. The broad question then becomes &ldquo;<em>Can we find a relation between IL8 and pain?</em>&rdquo; (Note that some papers have mentioned that there might be disparity in data related to pain; can we think of an alternative?)</li>
<li>Besides preventing underdosage, regulation may also be valuable if overdosage of LNPs poses a risk of some kind of toxicity. <em>Is this the case?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To Do:</strong> Continue on these leads and collate data. Once that is done, models and other things can be worked out. </p>

<p>Dry Lab Mrigank Pawagi I searched for biomarkers for endometriosis. As of now, no specific biomarkers of endometriosis have been identified (laparoscopy and other methods are used to diagnose it) and none of the studies show very conclusive evidence of an increase in a potential biomarker in endometriosis.  I have attached two pdfs which I felt might be relevant as it has data of the studies carried out to determine if we can have a biomarker for endometriosis. The pdf titled &ldquo;Endometriosis epidemiology ..&rdquo;has biomarkers under section 10., and the pdf titled &ldquo;Peripheral biomarkers for endometriosis&rdquo; has data about the various potential biomarkers like IL8 and IL6 from page 657.</p>

    Looks like I won&rsquo;t be able to get the required antibody on time, so I&rsquo;ll be investigating a different method of testing binding specificity and affinity. 
Also, I found some really useful stuff. Namely, the mechanism of uptake of APTEDB-conjugated NPs is probably Caveolae-mediated endocytosis!! <a href="https://www.mechanobio.info/what-is-the-plasma-membrane/what-is-membrane-trafficking/what-is-caveolar-endocytosis/">https://www.mechanobio.info/what-is-the-plasma-membrane/what-is-membrane-trafficking/what-is-caveolar-endocytosis/</a></p>
<p>Further, I also found a paper discussing the distribution and accumulation of APT-EDB conjugated NPs in tumour tissue after an IV. 
I dunno if this is exactly what you guys want, but I thought it may be handy.</p>
<p>As for the exact binding eff of the antibody, I will give the data to you. It is not in the paper I sent in general, and I thought i had shared that one too.

    Anwesha Malla, Thanks! As promised, I will collate all the evidence I can and get back to you, hopefully by the end of this week
​[7/13, 12:24 PM] Anwesha Malla
    I added another link here. Aditya Kamath Ammembal, should I put all the links in this document in the other document shared in the iGEM confirmed group, earlier?
​[7/13, 12:25 PM] Aditya Kamath Ammembal
    Anwesha Malla, Please do, it would make everything easier for those collating evidence
​[7/13, 12:26 PM] Aditya Kamath Ammembal
    also, iGEM 2023 could I please have an update on the evidence collation thingie?
[7/14, 2:25 AM] Mrigank PawagiDocking of scFv with IL8 is complete!
    (Dry Lab) Our work on docking is tentatively done! I was able to determine binding affinity using PRODIGY. I have credited the guy from UoK in the README. Sheersh, please make a note of that for HP. Most importantly, I request all of you to thoroughly read the documentation and suggest any required improvements. <a class="magiclink magiclink-github magiclink-repository" href="https://github.com/iGEMIISc/Docking-scFv-IL8/" title="GitHub Repository: iGEMIISc/Docking-scFv-IL8">iGEMIISc/Docking-scFv-IL8</a>

<p>Dry Lab Here is the Word document with links to the papers that are useful for relating IL-8 concentrations with active lesions score. However, I have some doubts-There is no mention of active lesion score of 3 in the 4-point scale. Can Aditya Kamath Ammembal, Mrigank Pawagi , or anyone else please help me understand this? Secondly, I haven&rsquo;t found a paper with very well-defined concentrations of IL-8 in the various stages of endometriosis. One of the documents here deals with concentrations, but the stages have been clubbed together, like stages 1,2 and stage 3,4. It will be helpful if any of you too search for the data on the concentration of IL-8 in various stages.

    Wonderful! This goes in the right direction. Let us discuss this in a meeting this weekend. We can do some interesting things with this. We will discuss how we can fill in gaps in the data.
​[7/15, 1:05 AM] Aditya Kamath Ammembal
    Hi Anwesha Malla; sorry for getting back to you so late. For your clarification about the whole stage 3-4 confusion, I saw what you were referring to. In the rASRM classification of endometriosis, you will see that the lesion score is NOT the same as the stage of endometriosis. We add the scores to get a total, based on which we decide the stage. I hope this answers your question? 
​[7/15, 1:06 AM] Aditya Kamath Ammembal
    They are simply correlating the lesion score to the IL8 concentration
​[7/15, 1:07 AM] Aditya Kamath Ammembal
    Also, the lesion score can go to, like, 20 or something, if I&rsquo;m not wrong&hellip;
​[7/15, 8:06 AM] Anwesha Malla
    Thanks for the reply Aditya Kamath Ammembal . I was asking about the scoring of individual lesions, which according to a paper is as attached in the screenshot. Here there&rsquo;s no mention of score 3. Another paper I went through had same information. So I wanted to confirm if a score of 3 is not assigned to individual lesions.

    Yes, the lesion score is arbitrary, as mentioned in the paper in which it was introduced. This is why there is no 3...... To make things add up and fall in a range, most probably. 
​[7/15, 4:44 PM] Aditya Kamath Ammembal
    Anwesha Malla, this is in fact why, newer systems are trying to replace it!

    Chapter 4 of this Journal has description of many pharmacokinetics models. So does chpt 5.
Some of the modelling softwares mentioned in chpt 4 are
- Simcyp
- PKSIM( <a href="http://www.simcyp.com">www.simcyp.com</a> )
-CLOEPK( <a href="http://www.systemsnoilogy.com/products/pk-sim.html">www.systemsnoilogy.com/products/pk-sim.html</a> )

    Dry Lab I&rsquo;ve uploaded 2 papers in the PKPDMathModel folder. One exclusively deals with siRNA-LNPs and the other works on a mRNA-LNP vaccine model, like the CoVID one to predict immunological timescales. Both come up with purely mathematical models that require a bit of input from in vitro tests to deal with the entire PK business. I&rsquo;ll be going through them a bit more thoroughly and maaaybbeeee contact authors for some HP purposes grinningfacewithsmilingeyes
[8/6, 7:25 PM] Mrigank PawagiOn mRNA Optimization
    I was able to install all dependencies for Ribotree but there was some issue in running it on the example sequences. I wanted to transfer that repository to my local system but unfortunately, I have carelessly exhausted my storage and have been locked out of the online virtual machine till 15th August sad. I will get back to it then, because I really don&rsquo;t want to redo all of that. Sorry for the delay! We can try some other fully automated web servers for mRNA optimization in the mean time though. (Aditya)</p>
<p>I will update this post when this thing goes forward. 
​[8/6, 7:36 PM] Aditya Kamath Ammembal
    Ah, no probs! Is it possible to continue the work on another machine? Idk. If not, it&rsquo;s perfectly ok, we can be delayed for some time.
​[8/6, 8:15 PM] Mrigank Pawagi
    Yes, I can start over again. Should be easier this time though. I had a script with all the manual fixes in my (now) locked codespace. 
​[8/6, 8:53 PM] Aditya Kamath Ammembal
    Oh, cool. Do you need anything to be done by anyone? 
​[8/6, 8:55 PM] Mrigank Pawagi
    Not at the moment. I will delegate some additional tasks in the next dry lab meeting though. 
[8/7, 12:12 PM] Mrigank Pawagi(Preliminary) Work on Using LLMs to Improve the Biobricks Registry
    (Dry Lab, Human Practices) I have updated the following repository with documentation on the work that I was pursuing, for improving Biobricks registry entries using Large Language Models: <a class="magiclink magiclink-github magiclink-repository" href="https://github.com/iGEMIISc/biobricks" title="GitHub Repository: iGEMIISc/biobricks">iGEMIISc/biobricks</a>
I would encourage everybody to go through the README, and if interested, also through the model_<name>.ipynb files and suggest any changes (you can make a PR or tell me here) in the documentation or elsewhere. If you want to explore LLMs yourself and would like to work on this, feel free to let me know. As I mentioned, this is work in progress! 
[8/7, 12:13 PM] Mrigank Pawagi
    We have put our foot in the door on this thing. We can take up again after a while and maybe for now focus on the other thing which we were planning (Biobricks visualizer)
[8/6, 7:10 PM] Mrigank PawagiFor PK
    (Dry Lab) GastroPlus is a proprietary software and we cannot even use it without asking for a quote. There is an open source (yay!) simulation software for PK modelling called PK-sim and it seems quite promising. I tried the UI and it looks pretty comprehensive. I will suggest that people who are working on PK modelling download it (from <a href="https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/PK-Sim/releases/tag/v11.2.142">https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/PK-Sim/releases/tag/v11.2.142</a>) and maybe try it a little bit. Let us meet some time in the coming week and collate our previous findings to create something on PK-sim. In particular, I would want Tarushri, Sanjana and Anwesha to be involved since you have all been working on finding relevant data and models for a while. Please share what day &amp; time works in the comments. 
[8/10, 8:27 PM] Sanjana D S

    Dry Lab 
I think we should meet sometime in the next week to get up to speed. Does Wednesday evening work for all of you? We will just discuss what we&rsquo;ve been up to and how we will be moving forward with some of those things. Sheersh, we would be discussing some HP aspects as well.</p>
<p>Feel free to suggest alternate timings if the current suggestion does not work very well. 
[8/24, 12:05 AM] Mrigank PawagimRNA Optimization
    This is an updates post. As I mentioned on WhatsApp, I was able to install all necessary components for running RiboTree, and also fix some of the breaking errors in the tool (and also report them to the creators), to finally be able to run it. We ran it on 4 sequences today: Main sequence(seq), seq + 3&rsquo; UTR, 5&rsquo; + seq, and 5&rsquo; + seq + 3&rsquo;. Results (and input files) are in the git repository: <a class="magiclink magiclink-github magiclink-repository" href="https://github.com/iGEMIISc/mRNA-Optimization" title="GitHub Repository: iGEMIISc/mRNA-Optimization">iGEMIISc/mRNA-Optimization</a></p>
<p>The installation is done on one of the systems in the UG Computation Lab, and anybody interested in checking RiboTree out is welcome to do so. We will probably try exploring the configurations available in RiboTree to hopefully get even better results.</p>
<p>[8/6, 7:14 PM] Mrigank PawagiAptide &amp; Fibronectin EDB Docking
    Sanika it seems the docking has been done, and all that we need to do is</p>
<p>Upload the output from GRAMM and PRODIGY to the Repo</p>
<p>Create a GIF (for aesthetic purposes 😅) of the dockings. This can be done easily using PyMol (which you must have installed during that Homology workshop). Let me know if you need any help (with this, or with the 1st point, or both)</p>
<p>Great job!
​[8/6, 7:18 PM] Mrigank Pawagi
    There&rsquo;s an additional task that you can pursue (other people are encouraged to help) after this: Can you check if, and how, we can submit our dockings to the PDB? There is a computed models category as well. 
​[8/23, 7:52 AM] Mrigank Pawagi
    Sanika, can we also do some research on what the standard for K_d values is, for antibody-antigen interactions? 
​[8/23, 10:43 PM] Aditya Kamath Ammembal
    The standard Kd values are of the order of pico molar
​[8/23, 10:43 PM] Aditya Kamath Ammembal
    Aptamers are micromolar
​[8/23, 10:47 PM] Aditya Kamath Ammembal
    AFAIK, this needs to be confirmed thosweatgrinning
​[8/24, 12:01 AM] Mrigank Pawagi
    Aah, I see. We can try to find some source for this. </p>
<p>​[8/24, 9:38 AM] Sanika Amol Borade</p>
<p>In general: &ldquo;Most antibodies have KD values in the low micromolar (10-6) to nanomolar (10-7 to 10-9) range. High-affinity antibodies are generally considered to be in the low nanomolar range (10-9), with very high-affinity antibodies being in the picomolar (10-12) range.&rdquo;

    Great! Can this info be added to our README. Please make a Pull Request whenever possible. 
[8/26, 9:49 PM] Sheersh Sen
    Aditya Kamath Ammembal and Mrigank Pawagi, here are the papers I talked about. So firstly, I guess we&rsquo;ll try to look into the EPR effect in case of Endometriosis and how strong it is, followed by maybe highlighting important parts of the papers that have some actual quantitative data. As Prof Rachit mentioned, that seems to be the first part of actually coming up with a model for our system. Once we have some data on LNP accumulation and retention, we&rsquo;ll probably have to focus on the transfection efficiency aspect. Thereafter we use whatever mRNA translation data we have et cetera, but right now, this should have priority.
