 

Experimental plan (2) iGEM IISc ‘23 

WORKFLOW: 

    Design mRNA construct. 

    IVT, followed by tailing. 

    Purification using Mega Clear kit. 

    Culture macrophage cell lines in PGE2. 

    Test Phagocytosis ability before and after treatment with PGE2 using Vybrant TM Phagocytosis assay. 

    Transfect with mRNA. 

    Test the Phagocytosis ability of each culture using Vybrant TM Phagocytosis assay. 

    Flow Cytometry and Confocal are as follows: 

 
(Human macrophages were incubated first with a mouse monoclonal anti-human CD36 for 60 minutes on ice and second with a FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 60 minutes on ice in the dark. Mouse IgG was used as isotype control. 

Flow cytometry was performed, and at least 10,000 cells were analysed. For immunoimaging, macrophages were rinsed twice with PBS, fixed with 3.7% buffered paraformaldehyde, permeabilised with 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 15 minutes, and then stained with Hoechst 33258 and FITC-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-CD36 for 15 minutes on ice in the dark. The cells were then detected by scanning confocal laser microscopy.)[1] 

    Time points for confocal! Repeated confocal at fixed time points: (TBD after discussions) 

    Conjugate fMLFKC^ to mPEG5K MAL* as follows: 

 

(mPEG5K-maleimide (11.2 mg, 2 mmol) was dissolved in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) at room temperature. To this were added 3 equivalents of fMLFKC (4 mg, 6 mmol). The reaction was stirred overnight at room temperature.)[2] 

 

    Analysis of reaction through MALDI-TOF: 

 

(The difference in molecular weight between the final nanocarrier and the unreacted PEG corresponds to the molecular weight additions on the PEG skeleton. The relative intensity for unconjugated PEG is much lower than that of its peptidic core conjugated counterpart since the unconjugated PEG cannot be ionised to the same extent.) [2] 

 

    Assembly of LNP with mRNA. 

    Test in a macrophage cell line, again with two populations of cells. 

 

^ We may have to get this custom synthesised. Please investigate. 

*Not 100% sure this is the chemical required. Please investigate. 

I HAVE LEFT THE ’PHASE’ PAGE EMPTY UNTIL SUCH A TIME AS WE CAN CONFIRM THE AVAILABILITY OF CONSUMABLES.
