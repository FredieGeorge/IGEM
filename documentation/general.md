    iGEM 2023For the biofilms idea, these are the areas to work upon: 1. Read and extract specifics from the Pasteur wiki
    2. Read on the other approaches to inhibition

Hello everyone! 

Please fill out this form about your summer breaks. It will help us plan out our educational campaign and wet lab schedules.

https://forms.office.com/r/vDmwfxj4zY

We have identified multiple schools in each city, and will only assign the maximum you want to take. It would be great for our education campaign, so please do it at the earliest.

Is that the correct scFv in the illustration (doesn't look like so)? We finally settled on AlphaFold with PDB70. Also we can put the docking image.
​[7/2, 10:48 PM] Aditya Kamath Ammembal
    I put it through alpha fold again: If you upload the proper one and label it as the one generated by us, it would be great!
