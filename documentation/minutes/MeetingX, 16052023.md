    Bacterial Transformations 

    Transformation tutorials on Saturday 

    Abhilash is ready to teach 

    IVT, Linearization, etc have to be stalled till Bartika returns 

    Finalized Plasmid with GenScript 

    Will take a month to reach us 

    Microfluidics teams will be meeting Nishant 

    Sometime this or next week 

    Protein Purif. and ELISA 

    Debasis' students will inform us eventually for training sessions 

    LNP Characterization 

    We worry about it after we make the mRNA 

    Should be very straightforward 

    We're not synthesizing anything, he'll just provide them to us 

    Still need to buy Lipid powder from Sigma 

    Only after 2 months, after mRNA produced 

    Mammalian Cell Culture 

    PhD study ready to train us 

    GenScript also asked to synthesize a small amount of mRNA for us, which will behave as control, to be tested on mammalian cells 

    Will allow us to get control data, very quick, may give confirmation of our antibody production 

    Also, do not want to depend on Asimov for this 

BioBricks 

    Need to submit for iGEM 

    Basically to make things open source 

    Has a Prefix-Part-Suffix 

    Prefix/Suffix has restriciton enzymes not allowed to be in the 'Part' 

    Until last year, we need to submit one 'improved' BB and a new one, but this time this criteria has been relaxed 

    We have our improved T7 Promoter 

    New one's got like 37 bases, to improve transcriptional efficiency 

    We're changing a G to an A, making it easier to cap using CleanCap from Trilink 

    Might even be a new one, since we're adding 19 new bases 

    CD33 Signal Peptide 

    Not in the Registry 

    New part! 

    Antibody Gene 

Sponsors/Budget 

    We need like 30-40% discount 

    We might ask ThermoFisher for a sponsorship 

    Yay! Paris! Ya'll gotta stop the politics smfh
