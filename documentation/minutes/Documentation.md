Endometriosis: 

No good for prostate realization, exosomes for diagnosis, 17 jan later then exosome good delivery, 11 feb hernia repair in stem cells, hence connective tissue growth factor, hence endometriosis, hence connection, blocking ctgf through drug delivery mechanisms exosomes, miRNA 214 does that, fusion protein for specificity of Lamp2B and extradomain A of fibronectin, pack exosome with miRNA 214 then better alternative miRNA 503, HEK 293t best system for exosomes prodn, PhD pointed out we couldn’t get antibody, idea died 

Rachit recommended for delivery of mirna, but no synbio 

Aptides, specific aptide to extradomain, paper il 10 positive on endometriosis tissue, contadictory evidence, il 8 close to 0 contradictory, mrna while having a shower, mrna delivery using homing peptide, coating mrna similar to covid

People Based Interactions 

1. Dipshikha Chakraborty 

18th Feb Introduced Idea, got interested 

24th March Anti IL8 idea, noice, go ahead, biofim kill yourself 

6th April Siddharth PI  

10th April Abhilash Plasmid Design  

2nd May New name, logo 

17th May Sec PI 

7th June CD 36 idea introduced, very good, phagocytic assay of latex bead, recycling good, happens even without extra peptides, membrane proteins energy demanding 

26th June Lots of changes, Controls introduced, Angiogenesis assay, Triton X100 for experimental control, scientific design better, Confocal measurements repetitively to test hypotheses 

3rd July Put in contact with Shrabani Mukherjee NIRCH, Shrabani gave contact of Geetanjali Sachdeva, IL8 is fine, will have to CD36 check glycosilation state when produced using mrna 

26th July Pre AIIM meeting 

Meeting to discuss the or 

3rd September Redo Western Blot Bands should be very clear, if positive result, make it spotless 

15th August sent paper on treatment of leukemia using rna therapeutics lnp kills the cell, figured a loophole in moderna’s patent 

Rhea:  Ampicillin bad, asked us to find out why 

 

2. Rachit Aggarwal 

2nd March Recommends LNPs instead of exosomes – details in meeting minutes 

22nd March Buy Lipids online, finalized lipid idea  

14th April  PI  What would I have to do, sign stuff and lab space 

24th April Project Design discussions, design budget, experimental plans made earlier discussed, huge changes in the plans 

10th May Wetlab Training, sharu and Yashwant contacts 

18th May Weekly Updates 

..Admin Work.. 

10th June CD 36 introduced, Get: Check other diseases CD36, Cells compensatory ? bcuz macrophages plastic, hence mrna any impact, taking out monocytes differentiating them, transfecting them with plasmid and injecting back into the peritoneum, useful avenue for therapeutics, but mrna based so no (normally done) 

26th July Bad Western Blot 

9th August Submitted, Clearance of ScFvs, Increase Circulation time of LNPs, IV vs IM : Do experiments but likely IV is better 

Send data and pics of gels, urea or separating IBs, Fits hypothesis that inclusion bodies, Refolding doesn’t happen most times, but opposite to popular evidence, Better to do Functional Assay, contact dipankar nandi, IL8 doesn’t get plated, he said take his kit, Gave feedback for PkPd 

3. Mrinmoy 

22nd March Suggested to check mass and charge on antibody 

21st April Prodipto assigned, for synthesis and help 

He cant synthesise lipid we want bcuz would require different synthesis procedure which he hasn’t optimised 

4. Mukund 

24th Jan RF7 and prostate  

10th March Exosomes okay idea but miRNA 3 decades but no light at the end of the tunnel  

8th April Introduced the LNP, Aptide, was ecstatic 

Helped us in retrieving stuff 

5. Siddharth Jhunjhunwala 

30th March Cool idea, damn difficult to get on ground 

 

6. Krishna 

RF7 good idea 

Krishna, 12/04/2023: Input and feedback about coordinator elections  

Feedback implementation: We worked upon the input to elect 1 more coordinator each. 

Take more bacteria for better growth, or the terrific broth, autoclave stuff, protein expression temperature, cofactors for purn, we verified 

28/6 Buffer Selction, check pI and usage of glycerol, desalting instead of dialysis 

the general suggestion is to start with a few basic buffers like phosphate buffers or HEPES buffer and then optimise based on the yields 

but yes if the protein ur working with isnt too pH sensitive then somewhat mild modifications shld be good enough 

Maybe seperate the IBs first 

check if the protein might be in it or not 

if not then try adding urea to lysis buffer 

maybe u can isolate the plasmid 

and clone it 

by the time u try to purify 

if purification doesnt happen and cloning happens first 

then try with gfp tagged protein 

make a standard with IBs and no protein and do a coomasine blue assay 

7. Kredai, Sid, Megha, Ayushi 

Gave the initial idea about iGEM, reviewed our brainstorming ideas and suggested profs to contact 

8. Nimi 

4/4 Contact established 

11/4 Agreed to mentor 

Weekly Targets 

Business model exists bcuz she told us to 
Contact Amit Singh for cell line cutokine pulldown in Hu9 cell line 

Said to make a map with all activities, highlight more of our HP 

SiRNA MiRNA  

Check for optimal affinity for ab: Better affinity better said by Rachit 

9. Jitendra Kumar Bio Incubation Centre Guy 

Mrna based therapeutics, even if it fails, essential bcuz mrna based therapeutic system non existent in india 

- 17/6 Ravi Kumar: suggestions in vitro chitosan derived delivery system  

- 15/4 first recommended binding efficiency test before experimental design 

21/7 Business Centre: Rita Sree Sarma 

Sequence of events: 

1. Project explained 

2. BM is either project based/service based 

3. We might introduce it as a startup in femtech (very promising, novel market) 

  

- Think of 3 main things: 

- Project/Service 

- USP (our solution is different at the very basic level + non-invasive + regulatory bindings are less) 

- What the consumer gains from it 

- Find out target demographic 

- How do we implement 

- B2B, talk to hospitals etc or direct consumer 

- Talk to other big companies 

- Find out quantities (how many local hospitals, how many demands/production capacities) 

- Look into standard/premium customers 

- Stake the global market 

- What do they offer 

- Pricing 

- Efficacy 

- How you're different 

- Make a graphic comparative chart 

- Look into Gantt charts + economic scale (lowering price once penetrate market) 

- Work with existing companies 

- Regulatory Act is less binding, can simply display good numbers 

- Discuss with a regulatory person  

- Look into IP rights 

- Commercialization will require licensing from AddGene 

- If IP has elapsed/abandoned, then free to use 

- Otherwise infringement 

- The process can be patented (protocol) 

- Provisional filing 

- Iff our lab work goes as expected and we can produce good data 

- 12 months to apply for India + PCT application (global/priority) 

- Will have to adjust and consolidate budget 

- In vivo helps 

- Natural progression of diseases can't be IP protected, we need a vaccine 

- But vaccine has regulatory hurdles 

Short and simple: what you are doing, etc. [Executive Summary] 

  

[Technical Description] 

  

[Problem Statement] 

  

[Value Proposition] 

- USP 

  

[Business Model] 

- B2B 

- This technology is not available in India... 

- Show figures, be realistics (how many hospitals... amount people are paying to get treated... how effective is it...) 

- Penetrate: can go to premium customer segment if not cost effective; can later scale to lower segment 

-  

  

[Team] 

- Size 

- Professor 

- Business-only person (MBA professor, somebody from industry, etc.) 

-  

  

[Business] 

- TAM SAM SOM 

  

>>> We will get a template to fill from Dr. Reetashri 

  

- Don't go too technical (diagrammatic representation is sufficient) make it understandable for laymen 

  

- Check LEAN Canvas 

  

Analysis for estimating pricing 

- Fixed costs, etc. 

- Cost benefit analysis 

- What amount of investment do we need? 

  

  

- Outsourcing to 3rd party for clinical trials 

- Employees (if any) 

- Consultants (if any) 

  

>>> GTM 

- License out to Companies (can we negotiate a non-exclusive license?) 

- Can we help companies develop their therapeutics using our platform 

- Territorial licensing, etc. (We retain manufacturing rights in India but license out to other countries) 

  

- Maybe not show too many things at once 

- Share other things for expansion of business 

  

>>> We are patentaable (mention this) 

  

- Find how other people approach companies (which are our potential B2B customers) 

  

>>> Market Testing 

- Try with doctors (Clinical trials) [Phase 1/2/3/4] 

- Get in touch with CROs (they are here at Bengaluru Bioinnovation Centre) [licensed study] 

 

 

10. Samarth 

13th March Gave useful insights and pointed out major loopholes, hence scrapped the idea  

15th March Aptide idea introduced 

18th March Analysed the idea, and was happy 

LNP IL8 Happy 

Really impressed with CD36 

Suggested to make more ppts for easy comprehension 

Reiterated Rachit’s Method  

Gimme RNA I’ll give you protein, No Me 

Double check conditions req for making lnps, talked to varkita, issue with construct, not lnp 

11. Abhilash: Taught transformation, initial plasmid design 

12. Vartika: Taught IVT, Tip of designing a vector with poly a tail now, instead adding later, but not followed bcuz no problem about efficiency,  

13. Vinod: God of lab, many crucial advice for wet lab, all kinds of help  

14. Lavanya: BL21 instead of TG1 

Troubleshooting APS 

Biosafety, Lab Rules 

15. Raghavan + Debajyoti: Plasmid Design (originally by Raghavan) Ammonium Sulphate, Also give SPR facilty 

16. Naturalists: Taught us important lab skills early like spreading, streaking, etc. Gave us early lab space 

17. Deepa Agashe, 03/04/2023: Correspondence about wet lab protocols 

18. Samay Pandey, 03/04/2023: Initial concerns about putting genetically modified bacteria inside the body, were sorted out after explaining our idea and approach. Gave a thumbs up to the idea and agreed to help with its various aspects. 

19. Reshma Ramakrishnan, 21/03/2023: Details about biofilms and methods of using enzymes to inhibit them 

Prof Mukherjee NIRRCH About Endometriosis Happy Idea, put in contact with director Geetanjali Sachdeva: make it more complex with more interactions, new pathway on biorender 

Karthik Mahesh 19/7 also suggested Model Model NCBS 

Prajakta Dandekar 21/7  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

----- 

Signal Sequence: Vartika Debajyoti suggested TPA, BUT recommended to find a homologue to TPA and something specific to our protein 

T7 sequence: Debajyoti GG to AG 

Transformation: Abhilash Yeshwant and Shalu 

Protein Purification: LB interfering, Ammonium Sulphate suggested Prof Raghavan 

Western Blot: Prof KN Balaji, Dont use chemisluminescence, we dont have developer soln dark room bcuz training lab no facilities, hence TMV+H2O2, learnt the hard way 

Docking Data:  

mRNA: Moderna tail suggested by Siddharth, Raghavan moderna UTR 

Optimised LNP: Mrinmoy standard ratio and move to optimisation, Pradipto more types of LNP  

Pharmacokinetics: Nishant and Rachit 

Organ on a Chip: Ramray Prasanjit IISc, Karthik Mahesh also suggested Model Model NCBS 

UTR splice varients but moderna bcuz kept total base length under 2k, and no time to optimise hence best 

Dhanalakshmi, from Debasis Lab 

Taught HisTAG for both supern and pellet, lent the desalting column 

Gave us BL21 

Devendra from Sainis Lab 

Bl21 instead of Tg1, Use Tris HCl 7.5-8 for ScFV purn 

 

Emulate  

J Konnowich 

Das Lab, Stanford University -> Dr. Christian Andrew Choe 

    How to get started with Ribotree 

    Initial troubleshooting 

    Suggestions on configurations (like folding tools to use) 

Vakser Lab, University of Kansas -> Amar Singh 

    Discussion on free vs template-based docking 

    Discussion on getting actual energy units 

Nisha (Rachit’s Student) 

    [5 June] 1. mRNA delivery in mRNA therapy (look at papers)  

    2. LNP delivery, what are the kinetics of that 

    3. Look at other similar LNP-like polymers, example PEG polymer particles 

    4. Try intraperitoneal injections, 

    5. Look at hydrophobicity of our particles and find similar drugs 

    6. Look at the siRNA paper, at uptake of these particles 

    7. Release kinetics, LNP delivery, LNP uptake and bursting 

    8. Aptide binding efficiency, efficiencies of all intermediate processes and the cumulative efficiency 

    9. LNP immune response 

    10. Look into therapeutic windows 

    11. Look into concentrations of IL8 that are toxic and work out required amount of antiIL8 

    12. mRNA translation efficiency 

    13. For modelling, proteins need to be similar to human proteins, and check stability, immune response, binding with IL8 

    14. Look at papers with similarities mote than specificities 

[ALT SUMMARY] 

Look at how mRNA is delivered (mRNA therapy)  

    Delivery through some other polymer particles 

      

    If not, look at how LNPs are delivered and the related kinetics 

      

    How peg particles are delivered (peg 2000) 

      

    How quickly the particles are taken up 

      

    Intraperitoneal injections 

    Just look at the free drug 

    Where the injection is given, how it reaches the cells 

      

    Kinetics of polymer particles 

      

    Compare hydrophobicities 

      

    Amount of siRNA given and the route it takes to go to the cells 

      

    Release kinetics 

      

    How mRNA is loaded into the LNP 

    Binding efficiency 

      

    LNP uptake, LNP bursting 

      

    Loss in delivery 

      

    If nothing specific with LNPs, peg polymers 

      

    mRNA uptake 

      

    Therapeutic window: 

    iL8 concentration that is toxic 

    mRNA translation efficiency 

      

    Choose the template so that the protein is similar to human proteins 

    To compare: 

    Stability of protein, immune response, more similarities to human 

    Check both docking and binding 

      

    Everyone: NPTEL COURSE
