iGEM 15th march meeting minutes 

Exosomes:  

F8 antibody issue: gene not available 

Patent issue with a biotech company 

Legal paper talk leads to too much logistics not a possibility 

 

SHLOAK IDEA (BIOFILMS) 

Growing idea with lot of potential 

Covering the biomaterial with a good biofilm of our choice before the bad ones come and try to kill people (main method or POA as of now) 

Lot of literature deep dive and wiki deep dive required. 

Gather as much information as possible.  

Biofilms: surface-attached communities of bacteria and pathogens that cause too much problems in biological implants 

Quorum Sensing: communication method in bacteria in biofilms 

3 main types: different organisms and methods of action 

Efflux pumps: transport proteins that remove toxic substances. 

Extracellular Polymeric Substances (EPS) Matrix 

Bacteria have higher resistance to antibiotics and higher transfer of genes – more resistance 

Higher virulence and pathogenicity. 

Higher resistance to immunological and non-specific defence 

Staphylococcus present mostly. 

Current method: not effective and very expensive (kinda not working) 

Potential Solution: E. coli or other harmless microorganisms 

                                   Inhibit biofilm formation (more viable) 

                                   Use biofilms to our advantage (not the main point) 

Weed project has proposed bacterial insertion (YAY!!!) Also bactoblood 

Kill Switch: Literature and previous projects available. 

                     We will need to perform. 

INHIBITING QUORUM SENSING 

Pasteur wiki has a method  

Brominated furanones and cinnamaldehyde analogs 

Can switch between gram +ve and gram -ve bacteria without too much hassle 

DESTROY EPS MATRIX 

TARGETING EFFLUX PUMPS 

SMALL MOLECULE INHIBITION 

DRY LAB: 

Simulating E.coli biofilm formation 

Simulate kill switch function 

Simulate inhibition by various enzymes 

WET LAB: 

Test kill switches  

Main guy: Rachit Aggarwal 

                   Deepshika Chakraborthy 

No human testing (only being proposed)  

NEW IDEA (ADITYA) 
Still a baby idea but can blossom into something good. 

Again read up a lot on aptides and please try and find roadblocks much earlier  

Using aptides (small peptides) 

Targeting endometriosis using aptides 

Aptides are very specific 

Fusion protein by conjugating aptide to a cytokine 

Plan to use interleukin-10 

Use a specific aptide and conjugate it to the interleukin and then deliver it (we create a lot of specificity) 

Should be possible if we get the DNA sequence of the aptide 

Meeting with MCB guy who says it could be possible 

Aptide can be attached to the lamp2b protein ( again exosomes enter the chat) 

Interleukin 10 is also used to target cancer  

Cargo can be quite a few options (need as many options as possible) 

General info: 

Talking to phds in order to learn the wet lab stuff and all 

Read as much as literature as possible and get as much information 

Go through previous years wikis (random information can come that’s highly useful) 

NEXT MEETING  

SATURDAY 9 PM EVERYONE COME OFF (MEETING WILL BE QUITE IMPORTANT)
