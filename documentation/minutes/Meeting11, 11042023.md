What we have to do: 

    The PostDoc's going to show us the protocols in 2 weeks: 

    IVT with kits 

    mRNA production 

    Promoter in the plasmid is Lac, needs to change it to T7 promoter (T7 is for transcription) 

    Add polyaptide tail to mRNA 

    Not sure of the cost. Buying a plasmid takes $85, though 

    Need to get IVT kit from Thermo-Fischer (~64K) 

    Give us everything except pseudouridine (need to buy from Trilink-Biotech, about 50K) 

    For mRNA production ~2lakhs 

    Cell lines cost 50K 

Total's around 3 lakhs 
(Someone check the values and data) 

People to contact: 

    Siddhart for mRNA 

    Prosenjit will put us in touch with his student. 

    Will meet Mrinmoy tomorrow to talk about lipid formulation 

    Talk to Rachit on friday and ask him to be our PI and also for dry lab components 

    Deepshikha for plasmids 

    Need to find better way to administer LNPs 

    Will present idea to BLR Biotech Centre 

    Will help us with models, general project design 

    SF lady has agreed to be our iGEM mentor 

    Can help us with scaling our project for industry 

    And the Patras Medicine iGEM Team. 

    At this point, no more people on brainstorming. 

Also, ask people for sponsorships. Basically all companies we're buying stuff from.
