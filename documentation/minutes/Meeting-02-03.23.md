Takeaways from the meeting- 02/03/23- Rachit Aggarwal 

    The Prof has suggested use of lipid nanoparticles over liposomes and exosomes as it is a newer technology with wide applications. 

    Prof. Mrinmoy Dey works on LNP synthesis. 

    We can consider NCCS Pune to procure required cell lines. 

    The oligonucleotide(miRNA214) can be either synthesised in lab or ordered online. 

    Prof. Siddharth works on this. 

LNPs 

lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)= nanoparticles made of lipids. 

Used in COVID vaccines.  

Can be used to carry particle such as RNA. 

Can be engineered for specificity.  

Are ionised and hence can escape endosomal digestion by the following mechanism/hypothesis : 

Mechanism:  proton Sponge Effect  

 

 

we have to: 

1.Identify a ligand that can bind to the identified marker 

 

2. Contact Mrinmoy Dey 

 

3. Synthesis of miRNA
